notes in this file as demonstrated by my instructor:
File Paths:
 Absolute start with /, inlcudes all directories between root and current
 Relative - start with .(current), ..(back), or ~(home), specifies location of a file relative to current
Some Commands: 
pwd - shows current terminal
man macse - manual
{} -h - help with that command
ls - list, with -F (shows / to separate directories and * on ends of scripts)
clear - clear the terminal
cd - change directory, move current directory to wherever you say
echo - repeat what you type
